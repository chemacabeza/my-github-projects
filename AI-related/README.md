## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to **AI Related** — the experimental zone where creativity meets computation. This section of my public GitHub repository is all about **pushing the limits of what’s possible with AI** — a playground for experiments, ideas, and breakthroughs at the intersection of technology and imagination.

Inside, you’ll discover:

* 🧠 **Hands-on experiments** with tools like Stable Diffusion and beyond — transforming lines of code into vibrant, intelligent art.
* 📘 **Learning notes and insights** from courses, research, and tinkering — distilled into practical workflows that make AI creation both approachable and powerful.
* 🚀 **Custom projects and prototypes** where theory becomes reality — unique explorations that showcase how AI can amplify human creativity.

Whether you’re here to **learn**, **explore**, **or be inspired**, _AI Related_ is your launchpad into the evolving world of artificial intelligence.
Dive in, experiment boldly, and see how far your curiosity can take you.

## CONTENTS

* [Running Fooocus on your local computer](Local-Fooocus/README.md)
* [Running Fooocus on Google Colab](Google-Colab/README.md)

## QUICK START

To build and run the local Fooocus environment (using Docker):

1.  **Navigate to the directory**:
    ```bash
    cd AI-related
    ```

2.  **Run with Docker**:
    ```bash
    make run
    ```

To stop:

```bash
make down
```

### Running Locally (No Docker)

If you cannot run Docker, you can run the application directly on your machine.

**Important**: Ensure you are in the `AI-related` directory before running these commands.

1.  **Navigate to the directory**:
    ```bash
    cd AI-related
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies** (run this only once):
    ```bash
    make install-local
    ```
    *This will clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and install all required libraries.*

3.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    make run-local
    ```
    *This will download necessary models and start the server.*
