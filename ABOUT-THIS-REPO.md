# About This Repo

This repository is my personal **engineering toolbox**, where I collect and share projects, experiments, and hands-on tips across different technologies I work with every day. It’s not just a code dump—it’s a curated set of examples, utilities, and learning notes that showcase how I approach real-world problems. From backend development to automation and even creative tech, this repo reflects my passion for building, optimizing, and experimenting with modern tools.

A large part of this collection is dedicated to **Java and Spring Boot**, where I explore building APIs, microservices, and scalable backend solutions. I focus on clean architecture, maintainability, and performance—values I consider critical in professional software engineering. You’ll find examples ranging from simple demos to more advanced integrations that mirror real-world production patterns, while also keeping the setup simple enough for anyone to try out.

Beyond backend development, I dive deep into **Bash scripting and automation**, an area I’ve relied on throughout my career to boost efficiency. In this repo, I share scripts, tips, and patterns for automating repetitive tasks, managing servers, and improving developer workflows. My goal is to demonstrate how even small, well-crafted scripts can save hours of manual work, reduce errors, and make systems more reliable.

Finally, I explore **creative and experimental tools**, such as generating images with **Fooocus** and experimenting with AI-driven workflows. These projects reflect my curiosity and willingness to experiment outside traditional engineering domains, applying software engineering practices to newer, fast-evolving fields. Taken together, this repository is a window into how I think, learn, and build—combining deep technical expertise with a drive to explore and share knowledge across multiple domains.
