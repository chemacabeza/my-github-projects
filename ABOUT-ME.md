# ABOUT ME

I’m a software engineer from Seville, Spain, with an M.Sc. in Computer Science from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. Early in my career, I was selected to join the Telematics Laboratory at the university due to my strong academic performance, an experience that set the stage for my passion for technology. During this time, I led a project to customize a Debian GNU/Linux distribution, enabling the automatic installation of software to support dynamic marketing studies. I also developed and maintained a communication system using facial recognition algorithms, sparking my interest in creating efficient, impactful technology solutions.

From 2009 to 2011, I honed my development skills at Cystelcom Sistemas, working on significant projects for Vodafone Spain and Helvetia Seguros. This role broadened my exposure to the telecommunications and insurance sectors, where I delivered solutions under high standards and tight timelines. Each project helped me grow my technical expertise and cemented my commitment to designing scalable, high-performance systems tailored to meet real-world client demands.

In 2011, I transitioned to Amadeus in the South of France, initially joining the Payment team with a focus on Java technology. I later moved to the Aftersales Pricing Orchestration team, where I led a project for Japan Airlines (JAL) to design an algorithm that allowed stakeholders to apply discount coupons, streamlining the after-sales pricing process. My work here gave me invaluable insight into C++ development and the intricacies of pricing systems, an experience that sharpened my problem-solving abilities.

In December 2017, I relocated to Edinburgh to join NCR’s Data Platform Team. This role allowed me to dive into data-centric engineering, working with technologies such as Java, Dropwizard, Hadoop, Hive, and Cassandra. Being part of a data platform team taught me the critical skills needed to handle large-scale data efficiently and inspired me to focus on data as an essential element of modern software solutions.

By September 2018, I had moved to Berlin to work with Klarna, eventually stepping into an Engineering Manager role in 2020. I now lead the onboarding team responsible for API integrations with key partners like Stripe, Adyen, and Mollie. Working with an exceptional team, I learned technologies like React, TypeScript, and JavaScript while leveraging a robust tech stack that includes Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, AWS, DynamoDB, and PostgreSQL. This experience has further fueled my passion for systems that support large, dynamic user bases with high scalability.

Throughout my journey, I’ve remained dedicated to continuous learning and system design, specializing in creating solutions with high scalability and availability. My background in Java and Spring Boot has been a solid foundation, but I’m always eager to expand my skill set, believing that innovation requires a readiness to learn and adapt. This commitment to improvement drives me to deliver results, lead with purpose, and continually seek ways to make a lasting impact.
